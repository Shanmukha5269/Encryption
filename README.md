Encryption using PyCryptodome (formerly PyCrypto) allows Python developers to securely encrypt and decrypt data using modern cryptographic algorithms. PyCryptodome is a library that provides cryptographic primitives, and it supports both symmetric and asymmetric encryption.

Hereâ€™s a brief explanation of encryption with PyCryptodome:

1. Symmetric Encryption
In symmetric encryption, the same key is used for both encrypting and decrypting the data. A popular algorithm supported by PyCryptodome for symmetric encryption is AES (Advanced Encryption Standard).

Example Process:

Encryption: The plaintext is encrypted using an encryption algorithm (e.g., AES) and a secret key.
Decryption: The encrypted message (ciphertext) is decrypted using the same key.
Steps in PyCryptodome:

Generate a key (typically 128, 192, or 256 bits).
Encrypt the plaintext using the key and an encryption mode (e.g., CBC, GCM).
Decrypt the ciphertext back to plaintext using the same key.
Code Example for Symmetric Encryption (AES):
